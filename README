To see how you might use MacRuby to create a Cocoa GUI for a Pharo app:
1. Launch the included Pharo 1.3 image with a Mac Cog VM
2. In Xcode:
    a. Make sure "TestPharoUI" is the active scheme
    b. Run the project

When you press the "Show time" button in the Cocoa GUI, it should show the current time, which has been retrieved from the Pharo image via HTTP.
